# Speech recognition of a set of words based on Hidden Markovian Model

The realised Speech recognition system of a set of words, based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), is divided into two phases:
- *training* phase, where the program is trained to recognise certain words, part of the training set;
- *recognition* phase, where there is the comparison of the voice input signal with the words used in the training phase.

The Hidden Markovian Model (HMM) is generated by an observation sequence. It constitutes by integer numbers sequence, instead, features of a vocal signal are constituted by real numbers. For this reason, it is necessary a conversion that keeps the properties of features. These features are represented by Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, delta and delta-delta.

A codebook is created by signals voice of the training set. This is useful for the vector quantization to reach the observation sequence. The quantization is achieved by the LBG-VQ algorithm by Linde, Buzo and Gray.

Problems of the applications of HMM are solved with:
- the *Forward-Backward* algorithm for the evaluation problem;
- the *Viterbi* algorithm for the decoding problem;
- the *Baum-Welch* algorithm for the training problem.
